#  Particle Filter

This project implements a particle Filter suitable for the Kidnapped Vehicle simulator scene.

It correctly compiles with cmake and runs against the simulator with the accuracy and time set.

## Accuracy

I have run the filter with 10, 25, 50, 100 and 500 particles with the following results :

|   N      |  Error x  |  Error y  |  Error Yaw Â |
|--------|----------:|----------:|-------------:|
| 10      | 0.157     | 0.148     | 0.005         |
| 25      | 0.133     | 0.124     | 0.004         |
| 50      | 0.118     | 0.113     | 0.004         |
| 100    | 0.116     | 0.110     | 0.004         |
| 500    | 0.109     | 0.101     | 0.004         |

Time of execution doesn't chage a lot with the number of particles, probably due to the overhead of other part of the program, the simulator.

## Performance

Times of execution are between 50 to 60 seconds, well below the 100 seconds allowed.

## General

Yes, the program uses a Particle Filter following gicven structure.

## Curiosities

When normalizing theta, the program doesn't pass because the simulators says there is an excesive yaw error. I ignore if it is a problem generated by the filter (although I don't understand how) or is the simulator that does not normalize yaw and so generates a bigger than usual error.
